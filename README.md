This Android application enhances your Spotify experience by allowing you to view your top artists and songs using the Spotify Developer API. It integrates Firebase for user authentication and database storage, letting you securely log in and store favorite songs and past Spotify Wrapped summaries. The app also features an interactive chatbot powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT API, offering predictions about similar listeners, and plays previews of your top songs.

Developed over two sprints using the Scrum framework, the app supports user account management, enabling updates and deletions of account information. Technologies used include the Android SDK, Kotlin, Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database, and the Spotify Developer API. The combination of these technologies ensures a secure and engaging user experience.

To get started, clone the repository, configure Firebase and the Spotify API, and run the app in Android Studio. Users can register or log in, view their top Spotify content, access Spotify Wrapped summaries, interact with the chatbot, and manage their accounts. Contributions are welcome via GitHub, where the project is available under the MIT License. Enjoy discovering your music preferences with our Spotify Wrapped Android application!
